2. The service formats the form data and sends it via EmailJS
3. EmailJS delivers the notification email to your admin email address
4. You receive the user's details and can reply directly to their email

## Troubleshooting

### Email not sending
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify EmailJS credentials in `email.config.ts`
- Ensure EmailJS service is properly configured
- Check if your email service has sending limits

### Template variables not working
- Make sure template variable names match exactly
- Check EmailJS template syntax
- Verify template is saved and published
